# flugel_framework
  Flugel is a framework built for small apps I may make in the future in C++.
  Right now it only uses OpenGL, but soon (hopefully) will also support Vulkan and DirectX.
  
  Flugel is based heavily on the wonderful Game Engine series by The Cherno and the Vulkan series by Brendan Galea.
